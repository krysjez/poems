A typographical device called an em dash
gives rhythm, gives pause
to words on a page.
Dances between ideas in dimly lit bars
filled with smoke, and body heat, and
intellectuals. One's writing a treatise
in the form of a cantata, between bars
he puts an em dash on the score:
breathe in -- breathe out -- 
don't stop now. Hold and support. 
Create space. That's what singing is:
making room for sound in your belly,
holding up, as ribs contract --
then expand again. As hearts expand, 
then contract again. Spaces between words
become breaths as one as you vocalise 'em'
empathy is created in the body.
